# NXTracker

NESTracker but for the Nintendo Switch, i'm in very early developpement and I havent developped for the Switch or even used C before so it's pretty bare bones for now but it will be slowly coming together after a few days.

Just put the .nro folder inside of the /switch folder on your SD card and boot it up using the homebrew launcher.

Just type 'make' in the zshell to build a new .nro file.

Use the left and right arrows to navigate through the console names.


Feel free to use this however you want.

The app is likely going to crash.
