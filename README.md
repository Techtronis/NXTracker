# NXTracker

NESTracker but for the Nintendo Switch, i'm in very early developpement and I havent developped for the Switch or even used C before so it's pretty bare bones for now but it will be slowly coming together after a few days.

Just put the .nro folder inside of the /switch folder on your SD card and boot it up using the homebrew launcher.

Use the left and right arrows to navigate through the console names.

The app is likely going to crash.
